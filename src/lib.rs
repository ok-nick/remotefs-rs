//! # remotefs
//!
//! remotefs is a library that provides a file system structure to work with all the most used file transfer protocols.
//! This is achieved through a trait called `RemoteFs` which exposes methods to operate on the remote file system.
//! Currently the library exposes a client for **Sftp**, **Scp**, **Ftp** and **Aws-s3**.
//!
//! ## Why remotefs
//!
//! You might be wondering what's the reasons behind remotefs.
//! The first reason is to provide an easy way to operate with multiple protocols at the same time.
//! For example, in [termscp](https://github.com/veeso/termscp), this came very handily to me.
//! The second reason is that often, users need to implement just a simple client to operate on a remote file system, and they have to waste a lot of time in understanding how the protocol works just to achieve a single task.
//!
//! With remotefs this is no more a problem: all you need is to configure the options to connect to the remote host and you're ready to deal with the remote file system, as it were mounted on your pc.
//!
//! ## Get started
//!
//! First of all you need to add **remotefs** to your project dependencies:
//!
//! ```toml
//! remotefs = "^0.1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! by default, these features are enabled: `ssh`
//!
//! these features are supported:
//!
//! - `aws-s3`: enable Aws-s3 client
//! - `ftp`: enable Ftp client
//! - `ssh`: enable Ssh client
//! - `no-log`: disable logging. By default, this library will log via the `log` crate.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The examples below, show how to implement a client with remotefs.
//!
//! ### Ssh client
//!
//! Here is a basic usage example, with the `Sftp` client, which is very similiar to the `Scp` client.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//!
//! // import remotefs trait and client
//! use remotefs::RemoteFs;
//! use remotefs::client::ssh::{SftpFs, SshOpts};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let mut client: SftpFs = SshOpts::new("127.0.0.1")
//!     .port(22)
//!     .username("test")
//!     .password("password")
//!     .config_file(Path::new("/home/cvisintin/.ssh/config"))
//!     .into();
//!
//! // connect
//! assert!(client.connect().is_ok());
//! // get working directory
//! println!("Wrkdir: {}", client.pwd().ok().unwrap().display());
//! // change working directory
//! assert!(client.change_dir(Path::new("/tmp")).is_ok());
//! // disconnect
//! assert!(client.disconnect().is_ok());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Ftp client
//!
//! Here is a basic usage example with the Ftp client:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use remotefs::RemoteFs;
//! use remotefs::client::ftp::FtpFs;
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let mut client = FtpFs::new("127.0.0.1", 21)
//!     .username("test")
//!     .password("password");
//! // connect
//! assert!(client.connect().is_ok());
//! // get working directory
//! println!("Wrkdir: {}", client.pwd().ok().unwrap().display());
//! // change working directory
//! assert!(client.change_dir(Path::new("/tmp")).is_ok());
//! // disconnect
//! assert!(client.disconnect().is_ok());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Aws s3 client
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use remotefs::RemoteFs;
//! use remotefs::aws_s3::AwsS3Fs;
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let mut client = AwsS3Fs::new("test-bucket", "eu-west-1")
//!     .profile("default")
//!     .access_key("AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxx")
//!     .secret_access_key("****************");
//! // connect
//! assert!(client.connect().is_ok());
//! // get working directory
//! println!("Wrkdir: {}", client.pwd().ok().unwrap().display());
//! // change working directory
//! assert!(client.change_dir(Path::new("/tmp")).is_ok());
//! // disconnect
//! assert!(client.disconnect().is_ok());
//! ```
//!
